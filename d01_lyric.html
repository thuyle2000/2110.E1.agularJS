No more champagne and the fireworks are through.
Here we are me and you, feeling lost and feeling blue.
It's the end of the party and the morning seems so grey, so unlike yesterday.
Now's time for us to say:
Ref.
Happy new year! happy new year!
May we all have a vision, now and then,
of the world where ev'ry neighbor is friend.
Happy new year! happy new year!
May we all have our hopes our wills to try
if we don't we might as well lay down die. You and I...
Sometimes I see how the brave new world arrives.
And I see how it thrives in the ashes of our lives.
Oh, yes man is fool and he think he be okay,
dragging on feet of clay, never knowing he's astray
( Keep on going any way )
( Back to ref- music )
Seems to me now that the dreams we had before
are all dead nothing more than confetti on the floor.
It's the end of the decade, in another ten year times
who can say what we'll find,
that lies waiting down the lines ( in the end of eighty-nine )
